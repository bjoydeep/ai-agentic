      "\n",
      "1. Observatorium API gateway: This component proxies the remote write request to Thanos Receive and also proxies the query request to Thanos Query Frontend.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "4. Thanos Store Gateway: This component reads historical metrics data from Object Storage bucket.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Thanos Ruler: This component evaluates Recording and Alerting rules configured by the user and sends alerts generated from Alerting rules to Alertmanager.\n",

      "\n",
      "7. Thanos Query Frontend: This component does some query result caching and splitting to make queries more performant.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Thanos Compactor: This component performs leveled-compaction and downsampling on blocks and writes new blocks back to Object Storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Grafana: This component is used by the user to make PromQL queries and displays the query result to the user.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. RBAC Query Proxy: This component verifies user role before sending the request to Thanos Query and returns query result to Grafana.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the spoke cluster, the following components are running:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. User Application: This is the application from which Prometheus scrapes metrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. In-cluster Prometheus: This component scrapes metrics from the user application.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Metrics-collector: This component scrapes the Prometheus /federate endpoint and remote writes metrics to Observatorium API gateway in the hub cluster.\n",
      "\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "When a user application is scraped by Prometheus, what happens to the scraped data and where does it end up?\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "The scraped data from the user application is first collected by the in-cluster Prometheus in the spoke cluster. This is the first step in the write path. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the metrics-collector in the spoke cluster scrapes the /federate endpoint of the in-cluster Prometheus. This is the second step in the write path.\n",
      "\n",
      "The metrics-collector then remote writes the metrics to the Observatorium API gateway in the hub cluster. This is the third step in the write path.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Observatorium API gateway proxies the remote write request to Thanos Receive in the hub cluster. This is the fourth step in the write path.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, Thanos Receive persists the metrics in the form of TSDB (Time Series Database) blocks to the Object Storage. The Object Storage could be in any cloud environment chosen by the user, such as S3, GCS, Azure, or On-prem. This is the fifth and final step in the write path.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "How does a user's PromQL query get answered?\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "The process of answering a user's PromQL query involves several steps across different nodes in the ACM Observability setup. Here's how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The user makes a PromQL query through the Grafana UI running on the hub cluster.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Grafana sends the query request to the RBAC Query Proxy, which verifies the user's role before sending the request to Thanos Query.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The RBAC Query Proxy sends the query request to the Observatorium API gateway after verifying the user's role.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The Observatorium API gateway proxies the query request to Thanos Query Frontend.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Thanos Query Frontend does some query result caching and splitting to make queries more performant and sends the request to Thanos Query.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Thanos Query fans out to Receive StoreAPI to get recent metrics data, to Store Gateway StoreAPI to get historical metrics data, and to Thanos Rule API to get rule-based metrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Thanos Receive returns metrics data to Query by reading from its local TSDB. Thanos Store Gateway returns metrics data to Query by reading from Object storage. Thanos Ruler returns metrics data to Query by reading from its local TSDB.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Thanos Query returns results to Query Frontend which combines and caches parts of the results.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Thanos Query Frontend returns the query result to the Observatorium API gateway.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Observatorium API gateway returns the query result to the RBAC Query Proxy.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. RBAC Query Proxy returns the query result to Grafana.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. Finally, Grafana displays the query result to the user.\n",
      "\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "A user is not able to see their historical metrics, what can be the cause of that?\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "The inability to see historical metrics could be due to several reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Thanos Store Gateway - Hub: This component is responsible for serving historical data from the object storage. If it's not functioning properly, it could lead to the unavailability of historical metrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Object Storage (S3/GCS/Azure/On-prem) - Cloud: This is where the metrics data is stored. If there's an issue with the object storage, such as connectivity issues, insufficient storage space, or misconfiguration, it could prevent the retrieval of historical metrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Thanos Query - Hub: This component fans out to the Thanos Store Gateway to get historical metrics data. If there's an issue with Thanos Query, it could prevent the retrieval of historical metrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Thanos Compactor - Hub: This component performs compaction and downsampling on blocks and writes new blocks back to Object Storage. If it's not working correctly, it could affect the availability of historical metrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Network Issues: There could be network connectivity issues between these components which could prevent the retrieval of historical metrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. RBAC Query Proxy - Hub: This component verifies user roles before sending the request to Thanos Query. If the user doesn't have the necessary permissions, they won't be able to retrieve historical metrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "To troubleshoot, you should check the logs and health of these components, verify the connectivity and configuration of the object storage, and ensure the user has the necessary permissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "A user notices their metrics-collector pod is failing to write metrics, why?\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "Based on the topology, there could be several reasons why the metrics-collector pod is failing to write metrics:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Connectivity Issues: The metrics-collector pod in the spoke cluster is responsible for scraping the Prometheus /federate endpoint and then remote writing metrics to the Observatorium API gateway in the hub cluster. If there are network connectivity issues between the spoke and hub clusters, this could cause the metrics-collector pod to fail to write metrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Observatorium API Gateway Issues: If the Observatorium API gateway in the hub cluster is down or not functioning correctly, the metrics-collector pod would not be able to write metrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. In-cluster Prometheus Issues: The metrics-collector pod scrapes the Prometheus /federate endpoint in the spoke cluster. If the in-cluster Prometheus is down or not functioning correctly, the metrics-collector pod would not be able to scrape metrics and therefore fail to write metrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Authorization Issues: The metrics-collector pod needs the correct permissions to scrape the Prometheus /federate endpoint and to write metrics to the Observatorium API gateway. If there are issues with the pod's permissions, this could cause it to fail to write metrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Resource Limitations: If the metrics-collector pod is hitting its resource limits (CPU, memory, etc.), it may fail to write metrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "To troubleshoot this issue, the user should check the logs of the metrics-collector pod for any error messages. They should also verify the connectivity between the spoke and hub clusters, the status of the Observatorium API gateway and in-cluster Prometheus, and the permissions and resource limits of the metrics-collector pod.\n",
      "\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "How does a user get alerted after they set a alerting rule on Thanos Ruler?\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "After the user sets an alerting rule on Thanos Ruler, the following steps occur:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Thanos Ruler evaluates the alerting rules. If the conditions of any rule are met, it generates an alert. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Thanos Ruler then sends these alerts to Alertmanager, which is also running on the hub cluster.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Alertmanager processes these alerts and sends them to the user's ticketing system. This could be any system the user has set up, such as PagerDuty, OpsGenie, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The user's ticketing system then notifies the user about the alert. This could be through various means like email, SMS, or a notification on the ticketing system's user interface. \n",
      "\n",
      "This way, the user is alerted whenever the conditions of the alerting rules they set on Thanos Ruler are met.\n",
      "\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "A user notices a lot of slow queries, especially when they query for historical metrics. They also have alerts firing on Thanos Compactor? What could be the cause?\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "The slow queries, especially for historical metrics, could be due to a number of reasons. One possibility is that the Thanos Store Gateway, which is responsible for fetching historical metrics data from the Object Storage, might be under-provisioned or experiencing performance issues. This could be due to network latency, insufficient compute resources, or a large number of queries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The alerts firing on Thanos Compactor could indicate issues with the compaction process. Thanos Compactor is responsible for compacting and downsampling the metrics data stored in the Object Storage. If it's not working properly, it could lead to an increase in the number of small blocks in the storage, which in turn could slow down the query performance. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another possibility is that the Object Storage itself (S3/GCS/Azure/On-prem) might be experiencing issues, such as network latency or I/O limitations. This could affect both the performance of Thanos Store Gateway and Thanos Compactor.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's also worth checking the performance of the Thanos Query component in the hub cluster, which is responsible for fanning out queries to the StoreAPIs (Thanos Receive, Thanos Store Gateway, and Thanos Ruler). If Thanos Query is under-provisioned or experiencing issues, it could also lead to slow query performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, the issue could be related to the Observatorium API gateway in the hub cluster, which proxies the query requests to Thanos Query Frontend and returns the query results. If there are any performance issues with the API gateway, it could also affect the query performance.\n"
